# mysql-connector
MY school project is to create a MySQL connector
I have made this my school project to use Python as the front end and MySql as a backend to create an  app that takes care of the basic business of a PHARMACIST.
This is a very basic app and has an insatller.txt file to first create a database in the MySql client and then you can launch main to use the app.
Also, you can copy the response in the MySql client and use it in the Time taken file to check how much time did entire installation process take.

# Caution
Before running main.py enter your password argument in the code (the line is turned into a comment at line 138)
