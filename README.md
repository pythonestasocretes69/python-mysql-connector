# mysql-connector
Soham's school project to creater MySQL connector
I have made this as my school project to use python as front end and MySql as backend in order to create an  app that takes care of basic business of a PHARMACIST.
This is a very basic app and has an insatller.txt file to first create a database in the MySql client and then you can lauch main to use the app.
Also you can copy the responce in MySql client and use it in Time taken file to check how much time did entire installation process took.

# Caution
Before running main.py enter your passwd arguement in the code (the line is turned into a comment)
